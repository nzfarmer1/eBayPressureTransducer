# eBayPressureTransducer

Arduino code + libraries to read a 30PSI eBay 0-5v pressure transducer

(used as a hydroponic resevoir monitor - an IBC 1000L tank)

Note: don't submerge the transducer unless you are absolutely sure all wiring is protected!

Check the polarity. If you screw up the wiring you will fry the sensor!
